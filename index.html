            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This website was created as part of an assignment focusing on building a Node.js server to serve basic HTML pages. The HTML and CSS were generated by ChatGPT, while the main challenge lies in coding the server-side logic using Node.js.</p>
            <p>The content on this page, as well as the "About" and "Contact Me" pages, is mostly for illustrative purposes, allowing me to concentrate on learning how to set up a functional web server with Node.js.</p>

            <h2>Project Goal</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project is to create a simple informational website using Node.js to serve different pages based on the URL. The focus is on understanding how to handle different HTTP requests, route them correctly, and serve HTML content.</p>
